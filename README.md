# About the Project

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to categorize the risk level of HDFC Bank stock (HDFCBANK.NS) into Low, Medium, or High Risk, using monthly return and volatility features derived from historical data (2010â€“2022) sourced from Yahoo Finance. It includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, model evaluation with confusion matrix and classification report, and a scatter plot visualizing risk categories.
